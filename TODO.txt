O.O.B:

1. Update cycle counting for expanded synthetic instructions - already works
2. Talk to aviad about the printing of the expands
3. Add spacing for labels-Done
4. Do i must add expand level in the running? (aka: 4 Run program) -dont think so bc it is an input(maybe in statistics)
5. Are we sure we need parentheses for toString in instruction father? - thisInstructionString += (" " + DELIMITER + " " + parentInstruction.toString()); this!!!!!!
6. Are we sure we need to allow in the expansion command (aka 3 expand program) to expand without "0" option?
7. Can maxProgramLevel in Program be final? - lets try
8. Can statistics in Program be final? - yes bc it is a collection
9. The calculation of the maxProgramLevel in Program should be the maximum between baseProgram-1 and calculated, shouldn't it?
10. Add a condition to check if the expansion level entered by user is valid (aka between 0 and maxProgramLevel)
11. Bug in expansion (command 3): when asking to expand the program, it exceeds the max level by 1 (was checked once)
12. Need to check more than one argument and to see how it prints it (command 5)
13. Bug in statistics: prints new input instead of the original one
14. Bug: incorrect numbering of the instructions in the expansion (command 3)
15. (Not fully checked) Bug: incorrect instructions parents in the expansion (command 3)
16. (Not fully checked) Bug: incorrect used z variables (all of the were 0s in one test)
17. Bug: x1 is "after" snapshot but should be "before" snapshot
18. Bug: minus max level is not 1, is 2
19. Bug: after running expansion and then running no expansion, it doesn't erase the instructions with the work variables.

O.O.B:

1. implement calculation of expansion level for quotation
2. Each function / program should have its own history of runs
3. Update functions as menu items
4. Check that there's no function call in usage to a function that does not exist (from main program and also from other functions)
5. print the cycles in the quotation and JEF instructions as 5+ and 6+ accordingly
6. Switch button between debug and run mode (?)
7. Add a button to disable animations

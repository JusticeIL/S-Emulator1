O.O.B:

1. Make new JAXB classes for exercise 2
2. Make the rerun button on the history go disable if there is no run selected in the tableview
3. Implement resume functionality in the debug
4. Verify that "Cycles: ---" changes to "Cycles: 0" when a new program is loaded -- prefer it like this until run
7. Verify that "Cycles: X" resets to "Cycles: 0" when a new program is loaded

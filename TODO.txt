O.O.B:

1. implement calculation of cycles for quotation and JEF instructions
2. Each function / program should have its own history of runs
3. Check that there's no function call in usage to a function that does not exist (from main program and also from other functions)
4. print the cycles in the quotation and JEF instructions as 5+ and 6+ accordingly
5. Switch button between debug and run mode (?)
6. Add a button to disable animations
7. Cycles are not updated well between different program expansions

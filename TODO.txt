O.O.B:

1. implement calculation of cycles for quotation and JEF instructions
2. print the cycles in the quotation and JEF instructions as 5+ and 6+ accordingly
3. Each function / program should have its own history of runs
4. Check that there's no function call in usage to a function that does not exist (from main program and also from other functions); function-name calls are case-sensitive
5. Make the run button to be the primary button that runs the program according to the radio button selection (debug or run)
6. Verify that the cycles are updated well between different program expansions
7. Verify that the cycles label is updated correctly (also when switching between different programs)
8. Remove the option to click the columns in the instructions table (aka remove sort option on a column) and in all tables, except the pop-up table
9. Make x variables inside nested functions to be presented in the arguments table (or at least verify it works)
10. Make sure that if a program (or a function) uses x1 and x3, it doesn't let the user add x2 by himself in the table, but being initialized only in the code

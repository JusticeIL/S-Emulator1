O.O.B:

1. Handle TODOs in the code <Gal, Eitan?>
---
6. if a program is loaded valid or invalid, both should return a message to the client <Gal?>
7. User history table should be updated with a pull request from the server each period of time, less than 2 secs <Gal?>
8. the summary line should now present the instructions that fall to each architecture generation,
and if there are instructions that cannot be run in any architecture generation, this information should be red to be seen by the user. <Gal?>
Solution: expand the program so the user can run in the architecture or change architecture generation <Gal, Eitan?>

11. Debug option should calculate the cost for credits per step over; if the user has enough credits for the step over, we run the program a step, else we inform the user and move the user back to the dashboard <Gal!! just make the request and handle as I did in RUN>
15. Statistics per user, including Program/Function, programName / user-string, Architecture type <Eitan?>
16. Set 0 to be the default value for expansion level. <Gal?>
18. Change credits everywhere to be BigInteger / long <Eitan?>

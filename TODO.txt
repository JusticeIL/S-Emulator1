O.O.B:

1. Handle TODOs in the code <Gal, Eitan?>
---
2. User history table should be updated with a pull request from the server each period of time, less than 2 secs <Gal?>
3. the summary line should now present the instructions that fall to each architecture generation,
and if there are instructions that cannot be run in any architecture generation, this information should be red to be seen by the user. <Gal?>
Solution: expand the program so the user can run in the architecture or change architecture generation <Gal, Eitan?>

4. Debug option should calculate the cost for credits per step over; if the user has enough credits for the step over, we run the program a step, else we inform the user and move the user back to the dashboard <Check and tell me if that's what you wanted?>
5. Statistics per user, including Program/Function, programName / user-string, Architecture type <Eitan?>
6. Change credits everywhere to be BigInteger / long <Eitan?>

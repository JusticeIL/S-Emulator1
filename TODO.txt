O.O.B:

1. Update run to include a map of all variables and their values
2. Add a popup on show history that shows all variables and their values on a tableview.
3. Switch the plus and minus to a menu button
4. Make new JAXB classes for exercise 2
5. Make the rerun button on the history go disable if there is no run selected in the tableview
6. Export the lambda from the "setup new run" to a method so it can be reused in the history "rerun" button (and afterwards we do the assignment of the variables)
7. Fix debug to stop when finished
8. Add Cycles: --- on "setup new run" onAction and "Cycles: 0" when debug or run are pressed

O.O.B:

1. Create Client module and finish javafx GUI
2. Handle TODOs in the code
3. Save set<SProgram> instead of set <Program> for the recipes in order to create a program from sprogram; change program constructor or have a method.
4. functions container needs to sit inside the model to help 3
5. synchronize on function invoking instructions such as JEF and quotation.
6. Solve nested maps inside a new class (like we did with history of class statistics)
7. Create a module for the DTO from the existing classes of the DTOs.

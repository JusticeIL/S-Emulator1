O.O.B:

1. Talk to aviad about the printing of the expands - Aviad

3. Change printing of the X arguments (command 5) - Gal
4. Bug: x1 is "after" snapshot but should be "before" snapshot - Needs checking
5. Bug in show program: if it was expanded, it shows the expanded instead of the original - Needs checking
6. Bug in show program: shows empty label, not good - Aviad
7. Need to check if a destination label is legal
8. Bonus: try catch
